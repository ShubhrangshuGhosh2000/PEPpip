Official repository of the paper "_PEPpip: A Vision-Inspired Deep Learning Framework for Sequence-based Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction and Uncovering Interaction Maps via eXplainable AI techniques_".

- All experiments were conducted using a runtime infrastructure that utilizes a single machine equipped with 187 GB of RAM, a 16 GB GPU (Nvidia Tesla V100), and an Intel Xeon Gold 6148 CPU @ 2.40 GHz. The selection of machines for each experiment is based on the availability of a cluster with similar machine specifications.

- We utilized a conda environment with Python 3.11.4 for code execution. The environment was created using the [py3114_torch_gpu_param.yml](https://github.com/ShubhrangshuGhosh2000/PEPpip/blob/main/py3114_torch_gpu_param.yml) file.

- We explored multiple approaches while implementing our ideas, which resulted in a codebase that initially included numerous options, only a few of which were ultimately selected. We made an effort to clean up the codebase as thoroughly as possible before uploading. If you encounter any issues, please let us know.
